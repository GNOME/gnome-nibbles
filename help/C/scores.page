  <title>Scoring points in <app>Nibbles</app></title>

    <p>You can score points in <app>Nibbles</app> by eating bonuses. There are
    5 different kinds of bonuses in Nibbles:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>The donut-shaped bonus
	<media type="image" its:translate="no" src="figures/donut.svg" height="22" width="22"/> :
	This bonus causes an increase in the length of the worm.
	The points you gain on eating the donut vary from level to
	level and are multiples of the level number. In level 1, the first
	donut will give you 1 point, the second donut will give you 2 points,
	the third donut will give you 3 points and so on. In level 2, the first
	donut will give you 2 points, the second donut will give you 4 points,
	the third donut will give you 6 points and so on. In level 26,
	therefore, the first donut will give you 26 points, the second donut
	will give you 52 points and so on.</p>
	<note style="info">
	  <p>The donut order count does not depend on the number of donuts
	  already eaten by a worm. If the game is in level 1 and if player 1
	  eats the first donut, he scores 1 point, if player 2 eats the second
	  donut, he scores 2 points; a third player may choose to not eat any
	  donuts till the tenth donut and score 10 points at once.</p>

        <p>The heart-shaped bonus
	<media type="image" its:translate="no" src="figures/life.svg" height="22" width="22"/> :
	This bonus gives you an extra life and does not cause an increase in
	the length of your worm.</p>
        <note style="info">
          <p>The number of lives remaining for a worm is given by the number
	  on the left of the comma in a worm's score. If a worm's score is
	  10,005, the worm has 10 lives remaining.</p>
	</note>
	<note style="tip">
	  <p>You cannot get extra lives by scoring 10,000 points or more. If
	  you have scored 12345 points with 10 lives remaining, your score will
	  be 10,12345.</p>

	This bonus does	not cause an increase in the length of the worm and
	does not give you any points. It causes a reversal in the movement
	of all the other worms in the game.</p>
