2000-05-12  Andreas Hyden  <a.hyden@cyberpoint.se>

	* gnibbles.desktop: Added Swedish translation.

2000-05-06  Karl Eichwalder  <ke@suse.de>

	* gnibbles.soundlist: Add de.

2000-04-26  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* main.c (main): load_properties before setup_window, else we segfault.
	  How did this ever work?

2000-04-26  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* merged/modified patch from Sean Atkinson to allow configurable board
	  size (yay now all the laptop users can quit complaining)

2000-03-10 Elliot Lee <sopwith@redhat.com>
	* boni.c: Fix warning.
	* gnibbles.h: Increase GAMEDELAY to a level where newbie mode is
	actually playable.

1999-08-14  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* gnibbles.desktop: Use gnome-nibbles.png about which humanity
	seems to have forgot.

1999-07-17  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* gnibbles.c: Only take away points when you die if there are two
	players or more.
	* boni.h: Turned MAXMISSED down from 3 to 2, meaning you are now
	penalized sooner if you aren't getting normal bonuses and are focusing
	on the special ones.

1999-03-17  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* gnibbles_logo.png: Old logo screen removed.
	* gnibbles-logo.png: New logo screen.
	* Makefile.am: New logo...
	* gnibbles.c: New logo...
	* main.c: New logo...

1999-03-13  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* preferences.c (set_worm_color_cb): Stupid logic error made setting
	worm colors odd --- changing 1 or 2 changed 1's color, changing 3 or 4
	changed 3's color.  Forgot that 11 in binary is /3/.

1999-03-12  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* preferences.c (gnibbles_preferences_cb): removed pref_dialog_valid,
	since pref_dialog encompasses this information.

1999-03-09  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* gnibbles.c: gnibbles_log_score (): Check to make sure we started on
	level 1 before logging a score, otherwise ignore it.

1999-03-03  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* preferences.c: gnibbles_preferences_cb, destroy_cb: Added logic to
	handle being called while a game is in progress, paused or not
	* main.c: stop desensitizing the settings->preferences item now that it
	can handle being called mid-game
	* main.h: export the two functions needed by preferences.c, which I'm
	not thrilled about, but oh well

1999-03-03  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* worm.h: struct GnibblesWorm: removed pixmap, up, down, left, right,
	relmove, added an index into the properties structure which has all of
	this data
	* worm.c: updated several functions to access the global properties
	structure rather than the previous local copies of configuration data
	* gnibbles.c: small changes as above

1999-02-28  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Install menu hints

1999-02-28  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Relative movement grays out up/down key selection (preferences.c)

1999-02-28  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Added support for relative motion of worms instead of absolute

1999-02-27  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Added score stuff (main.c, gnibbles.c, gnibbles.h)

1999-02-27  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Added sound toggle to preferences, properties
	* Previous calls to gnome_triggers_do now call gnibbles_play_sound,
	which checks properties->sound and then calls gnome_triggers_do
	* Fixed potential badness / compile warning in scoreboard.c
	gtk_label_get

1999-02-24  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Added license info to *.c, *.h

1999-02-14  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Changes all over the place.  Added sounds.

1999-02-13  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Score values increase by levels.  Plugged a memory leak by actually
	destroying the scoreboard at the end.

1999-02-13  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed bug when you delete the window - connect to delete_event, not
	destroy.

1999-02-12  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* lots-o-files: Added the code for discouraging missing bonuses too
	much - don't try to run your score up anymore.

1999-02-12  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* main.c: in pause_game_cb, changed gtk_timeout_remove to
	gtk_callback_disconnect (Doh!), fixes many little bugs.

1999-02-12  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* scoreboard.c, scoreboard.h, assorted others: Added the scoreboard.

1999-02-12  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* main.c: end_game_cb now sets paused to 0, so as not to fool
	game_is_running.

1999-02-08  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* bonus.c (gnibbles_bonus_erase): free the bonus, free the memory, much
	better.

1999-02-07  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Removed configure_event_cb, since this should only be done once.
	Triggerd by the gnomedock stuff seeming to generate configure events
	with reckless abandon, even when nothing changes size.  Moved code to
	main.

1999-02-06  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Made the padding in the preferences dialog more consistant.

1999-02-06  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed a smallish bug in the confirmation dialog stuff.

1999-02-06  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed some stuff from yesterday, specifically bug in menuitem
	sensitivity stuff.
	* Added slight pause after unpausing the game.

1999-02-05  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Made the new game / end game / exit game menu items a little bit
	smarter - ie ask for confirmation, stuff like that.  Only when needed,
	of course.

1999-02-05  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Changed default config option for random levels to false.

1999-02-04  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed a bug when you finished all the levels.  Not just sits you on
	the last level until you die.

1999-02-02  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed some bugs in gnibbles_worm_grok_bonus, such as incorrect maths
	while doubling and halving, and stupid typo in case BONUSREGULAR, which
	meant nothing much was happening to scores.  All better.

1999-02-02  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed some memory leak in properties.c
	* Added configuration options to allow multiple players to set keys,
	set worm color, set number of players, set starting level.  Multiple
	worm play is now possible for up to 4 players, and this is an arbitrary
	limit - really, how many people fit on one keyboard?

1999-02-01  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed crazy little pausing bug - didn't pause when worm had died,
	erased, level reinitialized, during 1 second pause before worm popped
	out again...

1999-02-01  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed bug in loading per worm properties

1999-02-01  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Fixed a nasty bug when pausing while the worm is being erased and it
	is restarting the level...
	* Changed the new game / restart level behaviour slightly so that the
	initial bonus is shown a second or so before the worm pops up.  Helps
	with the pause issue from above, too.

1999-01-31  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* Wrote the game.
