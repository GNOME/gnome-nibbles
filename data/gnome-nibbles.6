.TH gnome-nibbles 6 "2024\-05\-31" "GNOME"
.SH NAME
Nibbles \- A worm game for GNOME
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnome-nibbles
.RI [ OPTION... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Control a worm in its quest to eat bonuses and become longer. Outmaneuver
enemy worms while eating apples and bananas to increase your length. Each
worm has six lives and loses one by running into a wall, another worm, or
itself. The enemy worms are after the same bonuses that you are, so be
careful. If the worms become too large, you wonâ€™t have much room to move.
.P
The adventure progresses through 26 maps of increasing difficulty. The early
levels are mostly open with a few walls, but later on, cramped spaces and
teleporters make things more interesting.
.P
Play on your own against up to five enemy worms, or share your keyboard to
play with a friend.
